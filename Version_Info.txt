v0 Adding Reference Materials: This is a compile of py examples to aid in my development in python. Most of this either
                                comes from physical books,W3, and self addons for python materials. Will go into depth
                                after completing some other objectives relating to a different subject.

                                Planning to increase python knowledge to make an Ai & improve a site concept for a side hobby
                                of mines. Besides that hope to help anybody that wishes to learn python and improve
                                their coding skills!

                                Will make this the main respo for any new python references until an update occurs. Besides
                                that have some fun, expirment, and learn.

--v1 Add Code Files to Github: Add current code to github, the rest are on local mach and backups, will slowly add them to
                                the github over time, will update this code as well. Have some big plans ahead ^_*
